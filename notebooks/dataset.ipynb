    "This is a simple Jupyter notebook which creates a dataset in Cumul.io via the API, using the Python SDK. You're seeing this in a Google Colab file which has created a copy of our template in your own account. You will notice some code blocks where you should replace some inputs with your own API key and tokens (so be mindful of who you share this file with and how you save it. It might be best to create a new API key and token to play around with this code and delete it after). You can also change around the code, add new cells, play around and enjoy!\n",
